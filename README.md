## ChaCha Okumalari

*ChaCha Okumalari* is an Android application that allows me to share my notes on the books I have read. The aim of the project is to build a book blog while having fun and learning more about Android Development. 

This is the User Panel of the project. User Panel version of the application allows the user to read everything I have written but they can not create, update or delete content. Admin Panel version, which is in a private repository, allows these.

## Contributing

As for the initial version of the app, which is the first version uploaded to Google Play Store, I made it by myself. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
